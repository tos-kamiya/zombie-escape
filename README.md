# Zombie Escape

The city is overrun with zombies!
You fled the horde, taking refuge in an abandoned factory.

Inside, it's a maze. They won't get in easily.
But you have no weapons. Night has fallen. The power's out, plunging the factory into darkness.

Your only tool: a single flashlight.
A car... somewhere inside... it's your only hope.

Pierce the darkness and find the car!
Then, escape this nightmare city!

## Overview

This game is a simple 2D top-down action game where the player aims to escape by finding and driving a car out of a large building infested with zombies. The player must evade zombies, break through walls to find a path, and then escape the building in a car.

## Game Rules

### Characters/Items

-   **Player:** A blue circle. Controlled with the WASD or arrow keys.
-   **Zombie:** A red circle. Will chase the player (or car) once detected.
    -   Zombies enter a direct pursuit mode when the player enters their line of sight (`ZOMBIE_SIGHT_RANGE`).
    -   When out of sight, the zombie's movement mode will randomly switch every certain time (moving horizontally/vertically only, side-to-side movement, random movement, etc.).
-   **Car:** A yellow rectangle. The player can enter by making contact with it.
    -   The car has durability. Durability decreases when colliding with internal walls or hitting zombies.
    -   If durability reaches 0, the car is destroyed, and the player is ejected.
    -   When the car is destroyed, a **new car will respawn** at a random location within the stage.
-   **Walls:** Gray rectangles.
    -   **Outer Walls:** Walls surrounding the stage that are nearly indestructible. Each side has at least three openings (exits).
    -   **Inner Walls:** Walls randomly placed inside the building. Inner wall segments each have durability. **The player can break these walls** by repeatedly colliding with a segment to reduce its durability; when it reaches 0, the segment is destroyed and disappears. The car cannot break walls.

### Win/Lose Conditions

-   **Win Condition:** Escape the stage (level) boundaries while inside the car.
-   **Lose Condition:**
    -   The player is touched by a zombie while *not* inside a car.
    -   (Note: In the current implementation, the game does not end immediately when the car is destroyed. The player can search for another car and continue trying to escape.)
