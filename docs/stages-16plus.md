This page summarizes notes for Stages 16-25.

## Stages

- **Stage 16: Floor Collapse**
- **Stage 17: Harder to Trap**

- **Stage 19: Corridors**
- **Stage 20: Rescue Request**
- **Stage 21: Running Shadow**
- **Stage 22: Still on Duty**

## Control Recommendation (Stage 21+)

From Stage 21 onward (when zombie dogs appear), a gamepad or mouse is recommended. Zombie dogs can rush in quickly from outside your view, so keyboard-only control can lead to over-pressing movement keys.

## Character, Item, and Terrain Notes

| Name | Image | First Appears | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pitfall | <img src="../imgs/exports/pitfall.png" width="80"> | Stage 16 | Zombies fall in. Humans can hop short corner gaps, but a missed jump also means falling in. If the player or buddy falls in, it is game over. |
| Reinforced Wall | <img src="../imgs/exports/wall-reinforced.png" width="80"> | Stage 18 | An unbreakable inner wall with the same toughness as the outer wall. |
| Zombie Dog | <img src="../imgs/exports/zombie-dog.png" width="80"> | Stage 21 | Fast charging zombie that also chases nearby zombies. |
| Patrol Bot | <img src="../imgs/exports/patrol-bot.png" width="80"> | Stage 22 | A dependable robot that can spot suspicious individuals; it paralyzes and damages zombies. While overlapping a stopped bot, release direction input once, then input a direction to command it. It cannot enter puddles. |
| Moving Floor | <img src="../imgs/exports/moving-floor.png" width="80"> | Stage 24 | A floor you can ride to move quickly in its direction. |
