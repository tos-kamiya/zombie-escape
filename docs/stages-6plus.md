| Pitfall | <img src="../imgs/exports/pitfall.png" width="80"> | Stage 16 | Zombies fall in. Humans can hop short corner gaps, but a missed jump also means falling in. |
| Zombie Dog | <img src="../imgs/exports/zombie-dog.png" width="80"> | Stage 21 | Fast charging zombie that also chases nearby zombies. |
| Patrol Bot | <img src="../imgs/exports/patrol-bot.png" width="80"> | Stage 22 | A dependable robot that can spot suspicious individuals; it paralyzes and damages zombies. Standing on the center lets you direct its facing. |
| Moving Floor | <img src="../imgs/exports/moving-floor.png" width="80"> | Stage 24 | A floor you can ride to move quickly in its direction. |
| Empty Fuel Can | <img src="../imgs/exports/empty-fuel-can.png" width="80"> | Stage 26 | Pickup item used in stages where the empty fuel can appears. |
| Fuel Station | <img src="../imgs/exports/fuel-station.png" width="80"> | Stage 26 | Refills the empty fuel can in stages where the empty fuel can appears. |

## Fuel Rule Change (Stages with Empty Fuel Can)

In stages where the empty fuel can appears, fuel handling is different:

- Regular fuel-can stages: `Player -> fuel can -> car`
- Stages where the empty fuel can appears: `Player -> empty fuel can -> fuel station -> car`

You cannot skip the station in stages where the empty fuel can appears.

## Control Recommendation (Stage 21+)

From Stage 21 onward (when zombie dogs appear), a gamepad is recommended. Zombie dogs can rush in quickly from outside your view, so with a keyboard, you might end up hitting the keys harder than you mean to.
